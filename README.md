# QuickPID

The API follows the [ArduinoPID](https://github.com/br3ttb/Arduino-PID-Library) library, however there have been some significant updates as follows:

- Library named as **QuickPID** and can run concurrently with Arduino **PID**
- Fixed-point calculations are used in `Compute()` to improve performance
- `analogReadFast()` added to provide further performance improvement
- `GetError()`added for diagnostics

### Performance

PID performance varies depending on how many coefficients are used.  When a  coefficient is zero, less calculation is done. The controller was  benchmarked using an Arduino UNO. QuickPID was benchmarked using analogReadFast() code.

| P_ON_M  Compute                               | Kp   | Ki   | Kd   | Step Time (ÂµS) |
| :-------------------------------------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | -------------- |
| QuickPID                                      | 2.0  | 5.0  | 0.0  | 88             |
| Arduino PID                                   | 2.0  | 5.0  | 0.0  | 104            |
| **P_ON_M   analogRead, Compute, analogWrite** |      |      |      |                |
| QuickPID                                      | 2.0  | 5.0  | 0.2  | 164            |
| Arduino PID                                   | 2.0  | 5.0  | 0.2  | 224            |

### Execution Frequency

A future version will provide further performance improvements by pre-calculating (scaling) the terms and providing direct timer with ISR support.
